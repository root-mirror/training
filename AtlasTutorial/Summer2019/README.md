# ATLAS tutorial

## Slides

The slides can be found in this folder as PDF.

## Hands-on

The hands-on is carried out using the Jupyter notebooks, which can be found [here](https://github.com/stwunsch/root_dataframe_tutorial/tree/atlas-tutorial-summer2019). Since all participants have a CERN account, the notebooks are run on [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch) but the notebooks are also runnable using [Binder](https://mybinder.org).
